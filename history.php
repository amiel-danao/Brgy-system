					<p>The name Maragondon was derived from Tagalog word madagundong or maugong, meaning much sound. Actually the sounds comes from a noisy river called Kay Albaran in the barrio of Capantayan. This area was the first townsite selected, but because the river frequently overflowed its bank and in undated the place it was later transferred to its present site. The word madagundong not being pleasant to ears, the people had it change to marigundong in honor of the town’ s patron saint, Nuestra Senora Maria Asuncion( Our Lady of The Assumption ).</p>
					
					<p>Soon after the establishment of the American regime, Lope K. Santos , an authority on Tagalog language and member of a geographic committee created to “investigate and revise” the names of Philippine towns and provinces, recommended the change of Marigundong to “Maragondon” definitely more pleasing to the hear, the present name of the town
					Incidentally, Maragondon has three foundation dates; namely, 1. ) 1611 when the Franciscan Fathers from Silang established their first visita or chapel; 2.) 1690, the Fundacion Ecclesiastica or founding of the regular parish by the Jesuits, dedicating it to Our Lady of the Assumption; 3.) 1727, the Fundacion Civil, when the original barrio of Maragondon was separated from Silang during the administration of the Recollects and converted into an independent municipality with Gregorio Silvestre has he first gobernadorcillo. Maragondon belonged to the corregimiento of Mariveles (now Bataan province) until 1754 when Spanish gevernor General Pedro Manuel de Arandia (1754 A- 1759) abolished the politico A- military administration and restored Maragondon Cavite Province.</p>

					<p>In the second half of the 19th century the towns of Ternate, Magallanes, Bailen, Alfonso, and Naic were mere barrios of Maragondon. Ternate was separated from Maragondon on March 31, 1857, under an agreement signed by Tomas de Leon, Felix Nigosa, Pablo de Leon, Florencio Nino Franco and Juan Ramos in behalf of the Ternatenos (people living in Ternate).
